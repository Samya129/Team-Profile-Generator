## Description 

With a Node.js command-line application, we can take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person with color-coded cards associated with their job title. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so by writing a unit test for every part of this code, we can ensure that it passes each test. By doing these following steps, we can ensure an application that is not only useful but efficient.

## User Story

```
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
